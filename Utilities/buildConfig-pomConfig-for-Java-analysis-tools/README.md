# Ant-build sample

runs the five tools Findbugs [1], Checkstyle [2], PMD [3], JUnit [4] and Cobertura [5]. 
Additionally it creates and collects the native HTML reports of each tool.
Ant-builds have the big advantage over Maven-builds that you have everything under control and a minimal foot print of the build result. 
This justifies the overhead of writing the build.xml file.
